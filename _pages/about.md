I will start my faculty career in the end of this year. 

<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;"> I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students/interns to join my group in Spring 2023 or Fall 2023. Please drop me an email if you are interested. </span>



I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University, working with [Prof. Daniel Rubin](https://rubinlab.stanford.edu/). Before joining
Stanford, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, working with [Prof.
Dinggang Shen](http://idea.bme.shanghaitech.edu.cn). I obtained my joint Ph.D. degree in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and City University of Hong
Kong under the supervision of [Prof. Yandong Tang](http://vision.sia.cn/our%20team/YandongTang-homepage/vision-YandongTang%28English%29.html), [Prof. Qingxiong Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4WirkacAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and [Prof. Rynson W.H. Lau](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~rynson/). 

My research interests span the area of artificial intelligence, computer vision and medical imaging processing, with a special focus on
1) deep learning-driven image acquisition and reconstruction, and 2) the development of trustworthy medical AI systems
from imperfect medical data.

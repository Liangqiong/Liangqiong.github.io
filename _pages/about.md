I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk/staff/liangqqu/) and the [Institute of Data Science](https://datascience.hku.hk/people/liangqiong-qu/) at The University of Hong Kong. 
  
 <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;"> I am looking for self-motivated Postdoc, Ph.D. students, and remote interns to join my group in Fall 2024/2025. Please drop me an email if you are interested. </span>

Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University, working with [Prof. Daniel Rubin](https://rubinlab.stanford.edu/). Before joining
Stanford, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, working with [Prof.
Dinggang Shen](http://idea.bme.shanghaitech.edu.cn). I obtained my joint Ph.D. degree in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and City University of Hong
Kong under the supervision of [Prof. Yandong Tang](http://vision.sia.cn/our%20team/YandongTang-homepage/vision-YandongTang%28English%29.html), [Prof. Qingxiong Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4WirkacAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and [Prof. Rynson W.H. Lau](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~rynson/). 

My research interests span the area of artificial intelligence, computer vision and medical imaging processing, with a special focus on
1) deep learning-driven image acquisition and reconstruction, and 2) the development of trustworthy medical AI systems
from imperfect medical data.

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in Stanford University, working with [Prof. Daniel Rubin](https://rubinlab.stanford.edu/). Before joining
Stanford, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, working with [Prof.
Dinggang Shen](http://idea.bme.shanghaitech.edu.cn). I obtained my joint Ph.D. degree in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and City University of Hong
Kong under the supervision of [Prof. Yandong Tang](http://vision.sia.cn/our%20team/YandongTang-homepage/vision-YandongTang%28English%29.html), Prof. Qingxiong Yang, and [Prof. Rynson W.H. Lau](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~rynson/). 

My research interests spans the area of artificial intelligence, computer vision and medical imaging processing, with a special focus on
1) deep learning-driven image acquisition and reconstruction, and 2) development of trustworthy medical AI system
from imperfect medical data.

Please drop me an email if you are interested in doing research with me. I am happy to collaborate.
